     Documentation for next migrations:

     We can call custom functions directly from mapping model with the following syntax

     FUNCTION($entityPolicy, "optionalNSNumberFromBoolSetting:" , $source.NAME_OF_FIELD)

     - entityPolicy corresponds to the NSEntityMigrationPolicy subclass here it's PersistedDiscussionLocalConfigurationToPersistedDiscussionLocalConfigurationV28ToV29 (this class)
     That is declared in custom policy field (don't forget "ObvMessenger." prefix)

     - optionalNSNumberFromBoolSetting is the name that corresponds to the declaration above, to verify the name it you can call:
     print(#selector(ObvMessenger.PersistedDiscussionLocalConfigurationToPersistedDiscussionLocalConfigurationV28ToV29.optionalNSNumberFrom(boolSetting:)))
     that returns "optionalNSNumberFromBoolSetting:" (please don't forget the colon)

     - $source.NAME_OF_FIELD is the field value that you want to give to this function

     - @objc is mandatory
