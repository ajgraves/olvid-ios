// This allow use to receive an interaction with INStartCallIntent in application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity when the user tap on a call in iOS Recent Calls view.
// If we don't do it the entry point receives an INStartAudioCallIntent (that is deprecated in iOS 13.0) instead of INStartCallIntent.
