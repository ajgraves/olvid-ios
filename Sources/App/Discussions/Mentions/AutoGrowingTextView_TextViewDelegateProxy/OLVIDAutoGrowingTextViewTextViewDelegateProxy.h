NS_SWIFT_NAME(AutoGrowingTextViewTextViewDelegateProxy)
/// A proxy that acts like a middleman to intercept and forward `UITextViewDelegate` methods to both a given instance of `UITextView` and its real delegate
/// The sole purpose of this proxying is to mitigate an issue within `UITextInput` where `-[UITextInput shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:]` wasn't called
///
/// This class makes use of the Objective-C runtime to load the appropriate protocol methods and discover them at runtime, making this resilient to API changes
///
/// - Remark: The `textView` will be the first to receive the delegate methods
/// - Important: The `textView` is **not** retained and is unowned (`unowned` in Swift, `unsafe_unretained` in ObjC) to prevent a retain cycle. This object **should** be retained by `textView`
@interface OLVIDAutoGrowingTextViewTextViewDelegateProxy : NSProxy <UITextViewDelegate>

/// Designated initializer to create the proxy
/// - Parameters:
///   - textView: An instance of `UITextView` that conforms to `UITextViewDelegate`
///   - textViewDelegate: The `textView`'s actual delegate
- (instancetype) initWithTextView: (UITextView <UITextViewDelegate> *) textView withTextViewDelegate: (__kindof NSObject <UITextViewDelegate> *) textViewDelegate;
