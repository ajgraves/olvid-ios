/// This class handles the process of stopping the continuous location sharing of a physical device in a discussion when the discussion is deleted.
/// When a discussion gets deleted, we execute this operation to send `END_SHARING` LocationJSON messages to other participants for all messages used
/// to share the continuous location of the current physical device. This ensures that other participants are aware that the sharing has stopped, as deleting
/// the discussion would delete sent messages where the location was shared and thus associated `PersistedLocationContinuousSent` instances.
