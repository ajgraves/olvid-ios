/// Very simple player used instead of the ``SoundsPlayer`` for performance reasons under macOS.
/// We tested several solutions for playing call sounds (including the system sounds framework and the AVAudioEngine APIs) and came up with this solution that uses
/// the `AVAudioPlayer` API. Although not perferct (sometimes, play/pause hang for a long time under macOS), it has the advantage of not blocking the main thread and does not crash
/// (unlike some of the tests we made with AVAudioEngine, that does not seem to be very resilient during audio interrupts, which often happen during an audio call).
