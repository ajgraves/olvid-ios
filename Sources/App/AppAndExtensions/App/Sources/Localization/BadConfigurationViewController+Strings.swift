If you wish to use Olvid, please turn it back on.\n\nThe reason why this is required lies in the fact that Olvid regularly executes complex, multipass, cryptographic protocols in order to achieve a security level no other app can compete with. These protocols happen in the background and could not work if you had to manually launch Olvid each time a cryptographic computation has to be performed.", comment: "Long explanation")
