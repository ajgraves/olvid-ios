/// The extension does nothing special for the moment. It is required though, as it allows to declare the `INStartCallIntent` in the `IntentsSupported` property list key of its `Info.plist` file.
/// By doing so, when the user starts an Olvid call from the list of "Recents" calls of the system "Phone" app,  the ``SceneDelegate.scene(_:continue:)`` method receives an intent of type `INStartCallIntent`.
/// Without this extension, the app entry point would receive a legacy (deprecated in iOS 13.0) `INStartAudioCallIntent` instead.
