/// Type used to return the notification content to publish by the app when inserting a `PersistedInvitation`.

/// The `ObvUserNotificationContentTypeForInvitation` full case also contains an optional `ObvProtocolMessage`.
/// This is typically used for the notification of a mediator invite: the notification extension publishes a notification by decrypting
/// a protocol message, obtaining an `ObvProtocolMessage` used to determine the notification content. When the app is launched, the protocol is executed, the app is notified, creates a
/// `PersistedInvitation`, which eventually triggers a call to this method that returns a notification content for the same mediator invite (but that has the advantage of providing accept and reject actions).
/// To avoid having two notifications for the same mediator invite, this method returns the `ObvProtocolMessage` that should correspond to the notification published by the notification extension, making
/// it possible for the caller (in practice, the `UserNotificationsCoordinator`) to search a remove the notification posted by the notification extension.
