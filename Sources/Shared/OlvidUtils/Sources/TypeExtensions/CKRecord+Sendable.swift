// Warning: This is a dangerous extension. We need this for now (2023-04-04) because of the way the AppBackupManager was coded. Beacause it is an actor, Xcode 14.3 raises several warnings that shall be fixed by refactoring the AppBackupManager. We will do so when integrating the multidevice feature and the new backup procedure.
