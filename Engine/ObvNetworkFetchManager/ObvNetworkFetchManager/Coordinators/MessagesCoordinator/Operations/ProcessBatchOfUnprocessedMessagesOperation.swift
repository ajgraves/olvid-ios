    ///
    /// Assume we always mark for deletion the messages that cannot be decrypted.
    /// Assume that we have many pending messages on the server. While we are downloading these messages and catching up, we may receive a WebSocket message that we are not yet able to decrypt, as
    /// the ratcheting has yet to reach the corresponding decryption key. Assume we receive a lot of these WebSocket messages (like, more than the number of keys in a provision) and that we delete them all.
    /// Once all the normaly-listed messages are processed, the decryption keys for the (now deleted) WebSocket messages are available. Those keys won't be used, as the corresponding messages do not exist
    /// anymore. Any newly downloaded message won't decrypt either, since the channel manager has no reason to go forward with the ratcheting (it expects the messages that we deleted). We end-up with a secure
    /// channel that is "broken" in reception.
    ///
    /// To fix this issue, we don't mark for deletion messages that cannot be decrypted if :
    /// - they were downloaded through the WebSocket;
    /// - they were downloaded using the standard list method, in case the server indicated that the list is truncated.
