    // Only when the `contextCreator`, the `notificationDelegate`, and the `identityDelegate` are set, the `ProtocolStarterCoordinator` can observe notifications. We notify the `ProtocolStarterCoordinator` each time one of these delegates is set. The third time, the `ProtocolStarterCoordinator` will automatically subscribe to notifications. Thanks to a mecanism within the DelegateManager, we know for sure that these delegates will be instantiated by the time the Manager is fully initialized. So we can safely force unwrapping.
